Add it to the folder where the SpinRatesAreHere python script is.

Updates:

1) Separation of disk and diskless stars
2) KS test for disk + diskless stars, as well as stars above and below 0.4 Mo
3) Bar plot of disk fraction as a function of period (will be changed to a scatter plot with different bin widths at a later date)
4) Calculation of rolling quantiles for period-mass at 10%, 50%, and 90%
